# Project 2 - Investigating Udiddit database
In this project, I first investigated the provided data model for potential errors such as lack of normalization, consistency rules, and proper indexing. Then, I created a new, normalized database using DDL based on the denormalized one that is provided. Lastly, I wrote DML queries to migrate the data from the denormalized schema to the normalized schema.

Key techniques used: SQL Database Definition Language (DDL) for creation of the data schemas in Postgres, SQL Database Manipulation Language (DML) for data migration.

**This project consists of two files**:
1. The project report file outlining my investigation, a new proposed schema for Udiddit and data migration details (created using LaTeX).
2. .sql file containing only DDL for the proposed schema and DML code used for data migration.
