# Project 1 - Deforestation Exploration
In this project, I acted as a data analyst for an organization on a mission to reduce deforestation around the world and to raise awareness about this important environmental topic. First, I joined that tables to another lookup table to bring in new categorical and quantitative variables and return a new view. Then, I created and executed SQL queries to perform calculations using variables from those disparate data sets to answer questions for stakeholders.

My analysis helped me to better understand which countries and regions around the world seem to have forests that have been shrinking in size and also which countries and regions have the most significant forest area. I then compiled my answers and summarized my analysis into a report that can be shared with a leadership team.

Key techniques used: SQL logical operators, JOINs, SQL Aggregations, subqueries & temporary tables and window functions.

This project consists of two files:
1. The project report file outlining my findings and queries in the appendix (created using LaTeX).
2. .sql containing only SQL queries.
