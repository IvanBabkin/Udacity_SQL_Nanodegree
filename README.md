## [Project 1 - Deforestation Exploration](https://github.com/IvanBabkin/Udacity_SQL_Nanodegree/tree/main/Project%201%20-%20Deforestation%20Exploration)
The purpose of this project is to first join existing tables to bring in new categorical and quantitative variables and return new views of the data. Then, create and execute SQL queries to perform calculations using variables from disparate datasets to answer questions for stakeholders.
* Key techniques used: SQL logical operators, JOINs, SQL Aggregations, subqueries & temporary tables and window functions

## [Project 2 - Investigating Udiddit database](https://github.com/IvanBabkin/Udacity_SQL_Nanodegree/tree/main/Project%202%20-%20Investigating%20Udiddit%20database)
The purpose of this project is to investigate a poorly designed database for Udiddit, a social news aggregator. Then, design a new, normalized and performant database schema and lastly, migrate over data from the previous database to the new database created using the proposed schema.
* Key techniques used: SQL Database Definition Language (DDL) for creation of the data schemas in Postgres, SQL Database Manipulation Language (DML) for data migration
